    <h1>Skript</h1>
    <p>... is a scripting plugin for the Bukkit platform. The syntax of Skript is close to English, but it is still not
      magic. While you might succeed with experimentation for simple tasks, for anything more complex you will need some
      guidance. </p>
    <p>This is Skript's documentation. You will find all supported features of the plugin here, along with some useful
      examples. </p>
