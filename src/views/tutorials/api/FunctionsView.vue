        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>Skript’s functions allow users to perform specific actions at multiple points in a code base. To allow addons
            to
            easily add their own functions, Skript 2.13 introduced a new API for registering functions, which uses the
            DefaultFunction class. Compared to the previous way of dealing with functions, this new API is a drastic
            improvement in several key ways.</p>
        <p>As an example, let’s register a function that removes a specific character from some strings, which defaults
            to
            removing all spaces.</p>
