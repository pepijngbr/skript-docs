        <h1>Conditionals</h1>
        <p>Conditions are ways to control what code in your program executes and what doesn’t. In other words, they
            allow
            you to do something if another thing passes some kind of check. Traditionally the check is something can be

            and
            cons.</p>
        <h2>Dedicated Conditions</h2>
        <p>Conditions in Skript are pretty straight forward: most things you may want to check have their own dedicated
            condition. Some others might not have a dedicated condition, and instead use a kind of “generic” condition
            with
            an expression. For example, let’s say that you wanted to check if a player is allowed to fly. You have two
            options:</p>
