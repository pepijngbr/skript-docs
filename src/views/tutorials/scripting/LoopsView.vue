        <h1>Loops</h1>
        <p>Loops are fantastic tools for anyone to have in their skill set. Loops allow you to repeat code, create
            countdowns, draw things, look for certain entities or items, and much more. They, along with conditionals,
            are
            your bread and butter for controlling how your program flows.</p>
        <p>In essence, loops repeat code. They have a block of code inside them and they run it, and then run it again,
            and
            again, until they’re done with their job. The details about how many times they run it (and what changes
            between
            each iteration) depend on the type of the loop.</p>
        <h2>Types of Loops</h2>
        <p>Skript, like most languages, has two main types of loops: for loops and while loops. Each has their own use
            case.

        <h3>For Loops</h3>
        <p>For loops are often just called “loops”, but I’ll be calling them for loops to ensure no one gets them
            confused
            with while loops. They look like this:</p>
