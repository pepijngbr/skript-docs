    <h2>What Is a Function?</h2>
    <p>
      A function is a bit of code, like you’d put in a command or an event. Unlike commands or
      events, though, functions don’t start running because of something happening in the game. A
      command might run because someone did /help, or an event might run because someone ate a piece
      of steak, but function run <b>only when you tell them to.</b>
    </p>
    <p>For example, let’s look at a basic function:</p>
    <!-- TODO: add more content -->
  </main>
